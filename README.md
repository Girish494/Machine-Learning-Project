# Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a collection of Machine Learning projects created to practice and strengthen understanding of different ML algorithms. Each project focuses on applying various techniques to real-world datasets, performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience by implementing and comparing multiple algorithms across different problem types (regression and classification). Performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as R², MAE, RMSE, accuracy, precision, recall, and cross-validation scores.

Through these projects, the repository demonstrates:

Practical implementation of supervised learning algorithms

Data preprocessing and feature scaling techniques

Model evaluation and comparison

Hyperparameter tuning and performance improvement

End-to-end ML workflow from data to prediction

This repository serves as a structured practice space for improving Machine Learning concepts and building a strong project portfolio.
